# 304CEM Front End Demonstration Code

#### Current Status

The repository is currently complete up to beginning the Week 9 worksheet tasks (tag:week9.1). Check out other git tags for known states (see section below).

## About

This repository contains the growing code-base of our example React-based single page web app.

During the semester we will add to and adjust the default boiler-plate React application set up by the command `create-react-app`. How to use this command will be introduced early in the module.

## Tags / Releases

Important commits will be tagged so that you can check out a tag and begin working from a known starting point (e.g. what is used in one of the demonstration videos).

Generally tags will refer to the week the code applies to and will have a description about its state such as _week 2 code after completion of basic worksheet tasks_.

To see tags in the terminal use `$ git tag -ln1`. In Github the tags appear under the 'release' subtab in the main repository 'code' tab.
